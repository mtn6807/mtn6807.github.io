                <h2>Stock Analytics</h2>
                <p>
                    My stock analytics project started out as a friend writing a small python script to analyze stock data. I 
                    thought it was an intesting project and they were lacking in web app design knowledge so I came on to help. 
                    I started by creating an architecture diagram and getting a trello board set up. Our project was to have 
                    dockerized Python bots which would pull in our data and perform our custom data analysis. From there it would 
                    send HTTP requests to an ingestion API, written in Node using Express, which would then store our data in a db. 
                    From there we had another API also using express which would serve data to our webapp. To accomplish this goal 
                    I ran a small team of around 8 developers, as well as did a lot of the development myself.

                <h2>Dependency Check Wrapper</h2>
                <p>
                    DevSecOps has become a bigger focus of my career as of about a year ago. I became fascinated with open source 
                    security tools. OWASP is an amazing organization which has made many open source tools and guides that have helped 
                    me alot, one being OWASP's Dependency Checker. The downside to Dependency Checker though is that it is only run in 
                    local instance, which wouldn't be very useful for a software development organization. So I created a webserver and 
                    client which would run a dependency chcker scans and upload the result to the webserver where anyone could see. It is 
                    not the most elegant solution but one that does solve an important problem. You can see my blog post on it  
                    <a href="resources/pdfs/DevOps_Blog.pdf">here</a>.

                <h2>Personal Website</h2>
                <p>
                    My personal website was originally the result of the RITSec mentorship program. None of my group members had any 
                    familiarity with HTML so we decided to use Github pages and make personal websites. It was a fun and quick project where 
                    I learned how to use Github pages. From there I spent some time learning how to embed PDFs, and eventually how to handle 
                    multiple pages and basics like that. While I don't consider myself a web designer by any means I am at least comfortable 
                    with HTML and it is now what I'd consider to be an active learning subject for me.
