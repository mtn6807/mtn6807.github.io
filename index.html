            <h1>Michael Nee Bio</h1>
            <p>
            I have always been an inquisitive person. My curiousity drove me to
            want to pursue many careers in life, but none have ever come close 
            to captivating me like Cyber Security. I have been fascinated by 
            the subject ever since I learned about it as a senior in high 
            school. No I am in my second year of pursuing my bachelors degree
            in Cyber Security at The Rochester Institute of Technology, where I
            am able to pursue my thirst for knowledge.
